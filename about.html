<p>
  Hello! My name is Jan and I'm a data scientist. I've spent over half a
  decade writing code for data science projects. My work has spanned the
  entire breadth of the data science pipeline, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Web scraping and database management</li>
  <li>Building predictive models</li>
  <li>Exploratory data analysis to discover the value of data</li>
  <li>Static and interactive data visualization</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This wesite is my data-science-slash-programming portfolio where I publish
  various open source projects of mine. I'm a firm believer in documenting my
  work, so most of the projects here will be written in an easy-to-follow
  tutorial format.
</p>
<h1>What This Is Not</h1>
<p>
  This is not a blog that eports on the current state of data science, machine
  learning, neural networks, visualization, or anything of the sort. There are
  not only plenty of blogs that fill this niche but also plenty of websites
  that list the relevant blogs. All projects shown on this page are either
  solely my own work or projects to which I contributed significantly.
