Hello! My name is Jan and I'm a data scientist. I've spent over half a decade building data science projects. My work has included:

<ul>
  <li>Web scraping and database management</li>
  <li>Building predictive models</li>
  <li>Exploratory data analysis to discover the value of data</li>
  <li>Static and interactive data visualization</li>
</ul>

This website is my data-science-slash-programming portfolio, where I publish various open source projects of mine. I'm a firm believer in thoroughly documenting my work, so most of the projects here will be written in an easy-to-follow tutorial format.

<strong>What this is not</strong><br/>
This is not a blog that reports on the current state of data science, machine learning, neural networks, visualization, or anything of the sort. There are not only plenty of blogs that fill this niche but also plenty of websites that list the relevant blogs. All projects shown on this page are either solely my own work or projects to which I contributed significantly.//-->
